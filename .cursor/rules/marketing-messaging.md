# Nova Marketing Messaging Pillars

## Core Problem
- Incumbent stablecoins (e.g., USDC, USDT) keep the yield their reserves earn.
- The GENIUS Act forbids paying interest to stablecoin holders.

## Nova Promise
- A compliant stablecoin where yield funds public goods instead of platforms.
- Holders and stakers advise where yield goes. Research may be first to vote on.

## How to Participate (Soft Launch)
- Connect wallet and deposit USDC to the pool.
- Receive NOGE receipt tokens 1:1 with your deposit; withdraw principal anytime.
- During soft launch, Aave interest helps bootstrap Nova; going forward, most yield supports public goods advised by the community, with a minimal, transparent portion covering protocol operations (compliance and security).

## Trust & Compliance
- Non-custodial contracts; audited; transparent on-chain receipts.
- Deposits supplied via Aave V3.
- Compliance by design: Nova does not pay interest to holders; most yield is directed to public goods in line with the GENIUS Act, with a minimal, transparent portion for protocol operations.

## Copy Guidelines
- Above the fold: clearly state the problem and Novaâ€™s promise.
- Contrast with incumbents succinctly; avoid jargon.
- Always include: how to participate now, withdraw-anytime reassurance, and compliance note.
- Tone: clear, factual, mission-driven; no hype.

## Snippets
- Problem: "USDC and USDT keep the yield your dollars earn."
- Promise: "Nova directs most yield to public goods you choose."
- Costs: "A minimal, transparent portion covers compliance and security."
- Compliance: "In line with the GENIUS Act: no interest to holders."
- Participation: "Deposit USDC, get NOGE receipts, withdraw principal anytime."
