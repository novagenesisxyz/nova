üßµ1/

Meet NOVA: The stablecoin that funds public goods instead of keeping all the yield üåü

While we love USDC & USDT, they generate billions in interest from YOUR deposits and keep it all. NOVA directs that yield to the community and public good

This is finance that gives back

2/ The problem is simple but massive:

Your dollars in stablecoins earn ~5% annually in T-bills and repos. On $150B+ in circulation, that's $7.5B per year.

Where does it go? To Tether & Circle's bottom line.

NOVA flips this model. Holding and using NOVA ‚Üí Public goods.

3/ How does NOVA stay compliant?

The GENIUS Act explicitly forbids paying interest to stablecoin holders. NOVA doesn't pay you interest - it directs yield to fund public goods instead.

Fully transparent. Fully compliant. Fully community-driven.

4/ Right now: We're in the Genesis phase üöÄ

This is NOVA's community bootstrap. No VCs. No private investors. Just people who believe stablecoins should benefit everyone.

Your Genesis deposits build the reserves needed to launch NOVA as a fully-backed stablecoin.

5/ How Genesis works:

1/ Connect wallet & deposit USDC
2/ Receive NOGE (NOVA Genesis) receipts 1:1
3/ Your USDC earns yield in Aave V3
4/ Withdraw your principal anytime using NOGE

The yield? Funds audits, legal framework, and protocol development.

7/ The master plan has 3 phases:

Phase 1: Bootstrap with USDC (happening now)
Phase 2: NOVA independence - migrate to USD reserves
Phase 3: Fund public goods at scale

Each phase builds on community ownership. No outside investors pulling strings.

8/ What makes NOVA different:

Democratic allocation: Holders & stakers advise where yield goes
Full transparency: On-chain receipts, public cost reporting
Impact tracking: See exactly what your participation funds
Principal safety: Only yields fund projects, never your deposits

9/ This isn't charity. It's a redesign of financial infrastructure.

Every NOVA in circulation automatically generates funding for public goods. Scale this to billions, and we're talking about sustainable funding for humanity's biggest challenges.

10/ Who decides what gets funded?

YOU do. NOVA holders and stakers will vote on allocation categories to advise the fund.

Basic research might be first. Then education, climate, healthcare, open source.

The community advises what the best public use is of the funds.

You're not just early. You're founding members of a movement to redirect billions from corporate
